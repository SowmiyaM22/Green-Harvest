Use the mysql utility to restore your database/table(s) dump to your Winhost MySQL database
Note: The following command will only write the data that is in the .sql file. This will not drop and create the database or truncate any of your other tables in your database.  The command will script all the table data in the .sql file to your Winhost database. If you have a table name present in your Winhost database that matches a table name in the .sql file, the table will be overwritten with the new data. Otherwise the script will create a new table and populate it with the new data.
